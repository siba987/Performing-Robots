## Performing-Robots

The link to a performance that I think exemplifies performing robots: http://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/en_US/events/2016/huang-yi-and-kuka/
Titled "HUANG YI & KUKA", it is a dance featuring Taiwanese choreographer Huang Yi, and shows the evolving relationship between humans and robots. It is an autonomous performance, but leaves the audience enthralled.

------------- PROGRESS ON GROUP PROJECT CONCEPT------------------------------------------


10/31/2017
I am working with Mei for our end-of-semester project. Our concept is the intersection of nature and technology. 
-Concept:
our idea is to have the robot, or actor, inhabit the nature which is a constatntly changing environment with
changing dimensions of connected wires which encapsulates the nature engulfing the city. 
The interaction between the actor and the software art is envisioned by the actoir's movement influencing the movement across the plane, 
and also in the movement of the robot in some way affecting the different dimensions of the software environment (i.e. mesh paterns).

-Size and Mechanical structure
We have a computer image of fixed dimensions and we think we can get a similar image with pixels mapped to the computer-based image and when the robot-cum-actor moves in the real world, there will  be a computer simulation (?) imitating and following the movements.

-Electrical and electronics
We will be needing accelerometers to record the acceleration of the robot, and possibly motion sesnors to detect chnages which will actuate the patterns. For communication, we think we can use two Arduinos with Bluetooth enabled.

------------------------------------------------------PLAN FOR THE COMING WEEKS---------------------------------------
Thursday November 16 
-> finish contruction of balancing robot, test that computer tracking is working.
-> prepare small ramps for the landmarks

## Tuesday Nov 21st
* Laser cut chassis for prototyping of balancing robot
* make circuit on breadboard for testing
*Note*: need accelerometer SN-ADXL 335-CV, gyroscope SN-ENC03R

## Sunday Dec 3
### Control from MATLAB (link:https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/examples/control-of-an-inverted-pendulum-on-a-cart.html?prodcode=RC&language=en)
*	Assemble the parts of the circuit: motor shield, 2x DC motors, PCB board
*	Laser cut chassis (make wider)
*	Write and test code in Arduino/Matlab:
  o	Find out if Matlab code can be saved to Arduino for line following
 
## Tuesday Dec 5
### Implementation
*	Test that all devices are communicating with each other properly
*	Buttons on Bluetooth controller to send messages to the robot
*	Power- check whether 6V battery enough for both DC motors

## Final Documentation
### Concept: What personality did you want to portray in your actor? How did you use technology to accomplish this?
- I wanted to portray a curious character, eager to learn about his/her surroundings
- I used Bluetooth LE technology to control the motions (back and forth, left right)

# Discuss the materials and construction techniques. Why did you chose these? Knowing what you know now, would you have chosen different materials or techniques?
For this project, I chose an acrylic base and casing for my robot. at first i cut acrylic brackets to enclose the DC motors but it did not secure the wheels tightly so I swapped it to metal brackets. If I had to do it differently, I would have stuck with acrylic casing
# What did you have to learn in order to complete your project? How did you learn this? (Include links to any useful resources)

### Schematic

### Overview, describing the general operation
The concept was inspired by Google Street View. We wanted to simulate the first person view (FPV) with the robo
### Electronic and electrical part of your project
* Describe the software part of your project


* Describe the mechanical part of your project
What were the 3 most difficult parts of your project?
Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently?
i would have planned the aesthetics in more details, or worked more on aligning the wheels together to increase complexity
