# Performing-Robots

The link to a performance that I think exemplifies performing robots: http://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/en_US/events/2016/huang-yi-and-kuka/
Titled "HUANG YI & KUKA", it is a dance featuring Taiwanese choreographer Huang Yi, and shows the evolving relationship between humans and robots. It is an autonomous performance, but leaves the audience enthralled.

I am working with Mei for our end-of-semester project. Our concept is the intersection of nature and technology. 
-Concept:
our idea is to have the robot, or actor, inhabit the nature which is a constatntly changing environment with
changing dimensions of connected wires which encapsulates the nature engulfing the city. 
The interaction between the actor and the software art is envisioned by the actoir's movement influencing the movement across the plane, 
and also in the movement of the robot in some way affecting the different dimensions of the software environment (i.e. mesh paterns).

-Size and Mechanical structure
We have a computer image of fixed dimensions and we think we can get a similar image with pixels mapped to the computer-based image and when the robot-cum-actor moves in the real world, there will  be a computer simulation (?) imitating and following the movements.

-Electrical and electronics
We will be needing accelerometers to record the acceleration of the robot, and possibly motion sesnors to detect chnages which will actuate the patterns. For communication, we think we can use two Arduinos with Bluetooth enabled.
