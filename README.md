# Performing-Robots

The link to a performance that I think exemplifies performing robots: http://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/en_US/events/2016/huang-yi-and-kuka/
Titled "HUANG YI & KUKA", it is a dance featuring Taiwanese choreographer Huang Yi, and shows the evolving relationship between humans and robots. It is an autonomous performance, but leaves the audience enthralled.
